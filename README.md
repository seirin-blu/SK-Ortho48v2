# SK Ortho48v2

A case for Cannonkeys' [Ortho48 v2](https://cannonkeys.com/products/ortho48). This case requires only a 3D printer and the items that came with the kit and SKUF feet. Only the HHKB variant has been tested, but the WKL and WK versions are assumed to work as well. 

The plate screws into the plate cover, and then the plate is sandwiched between the plate cover and screwed into from the bottom.
